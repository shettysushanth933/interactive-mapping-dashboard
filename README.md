This project is an **Interactive Highway Dashboard** built with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/), [Folium](https://python-visualization.github.io/folium/), and [leafmap](https://leafmap.org/). It allows users to explore highway statistics for districts in Karnataka, India, using an interactive map and dynamic charts.

## Features

- **Interactive Map:** Visualize Karnataka's districts and highways on a web map.
- **District Selection:** Click on any district to view its highway statistics.
- **Dynamic Sidebar:** The sidebar updates to show the currently selected district.
- **Bar Chart:** Displays the length of highways by category for the selected district.
- **Live Updates:** Both the sidebar and chart update instantly as you interact with the map.

## Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **Streamlit**
- **Folium**
- **Leafmap**
- **GeoPandas**
- **Pandas**
- **Matplotlib**

## How It Works

1. **Data Loading:**  
   - Loads district and highway data from a GeoPackage file.
   - Loads highway length statistics from a CSV file.

2. **Map Rendering:**  
   - Displays Karnataka districts on an interactive map.
   - Allows users to click on a district to select it.

3. **Sidebar & Chart:**  
   - The sidebar shows information about the dashboard and the currently selected district.
   - A bar chart visualizes highway lengths by category for the selected district.
